#Ansible also allows you to put variables into one or more files, using a section called vars_files. Letâ€™s say we want to take the preceding example and put the variables in a file named nginx.yml inst#ead of putting them right in the playbook. We would replace the vars section with a vars_files that looks like this
- hosts: localhost
  vars_files:
    - "./varsfilesvalues.yml"
  vars:
    Fname: kumar
  tasks:
    - name: display the values
      debug:
        msg: "{{ dresses.informal.lungi[1] }}  and name is {{ Fname }}"
